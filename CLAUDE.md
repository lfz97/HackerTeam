## Environment
- Repo lives on WSL2-mounted NTFS (OneDrive path at `/mnt/d/`) — run `git config --global --add safe.directory "/mnt/d/OneDrive - 上海达美乐比萨有限公司/documents/docs/code/go-code/MyProjects/git space/HackerTeam"` before any git commands
- `git` commands via Bash tool fail with "dubious ownership" without the safe.directory fix above
- `.go` files use CRLF line endings (Windows), `.md` files use LF — `Edit` tool fails on CRLF files, use `python3 -c "..."` via Bash instead
- `sed -i` fails with "Operation not permitted" on NTFS — write to `/tmp` and `cp` back, or use Python for in-place edits
- CRLF-safe edit for `.go` files: `python3 -c "import pathlib; p=pathlib.Path('file.go'); c=p.read_text(); c=c.replace('OLD','NEW'); p.write_text(c)"`

## Build & Run
- `go build -ldflags "-s -w" -o HackerTeam .` — build for current platform
- `.\build.ps1` — cross-compile all platforms (PowerShell)
- `make` or `make linux-x64` etc. — cross-compile (Makefile)
- `go run .` — run directly (auto-loads config from `<cwd>/.HackerTeam/`)
- `go vet ./...` — static analysis (passes clean)
- Go module: `HackerTeam` (Go 1.26)

## Architecture
- Multi-agent AI pentesting platform: Captain serially dispatches Recon → Scanner → Exploit (cross-validate) → PostExploit, plus Reproducer in two batches (Batch1: after Scanner+Exploit, Batch2: after PostExploit)
- Each agent prompt must have a "职责边界" rule as the first constraint — explicitly list what this agent MUST NOT do and WHICH agent handles that; LLMs cross role boundaries unless explicitly forbidden (Recon may try sqlmap, Scanner may try to exploit). Forbidding tool NAMES is not enough — LLMs bypass "don't use sqlmap" by doing manual injection with the same payloads. Forbid concrete BEHAVIORS with exact examples (e.g. "NEVER append ' / OR 1=1 / UNION SELECT to URL params") so the LLM cannot self-rationalize. Do NOT add cross-boundary refusal logic on sub-agents — if Recon rejects and Scanner also rejects, tasks deadlock; enforce boundaries on Captain's dispatch side only, accept the risk of Captain hallucination.
- Shared consensus system in `bootstrap/prompts/common/`: `vuln_consensus.md` (vulnerability definition + severity rating by technical impact, no CVSS), `output_consensus.md` (output format, raw tool output preservation, vulnerability structured block format for Reproducer consumption)
- TUI built with `rivo/tview` + `gdamore/tcell/v2`, PTY execution via `creack/pty`
- Agent framework: `trpc.group/trpc-go/trpc-agent-go`, MCP: `trpc.group/trpc-go/trpc-mcp-go`
- LLM backends: OpenAI-compatible API or Anthropic native SDK
- Config auto-generated at first run: `<binary-dir>/.HackerTeam/HackerTeam.yaml`
- TUI colors centralized in `utils/pretty/pretty.go` (TuiXxx constants)
- `/new`, `/flush`, `/exit`, `ESC` — built-in TUI commands
- Agent prompts embedded via `//go:embed` in `bootstrap/` (`PromptFiles`, `prompts/*` prefix in ReadFile) and `session/` (`promptFiles`, `prompt/*` prefix)
- Adding a new shared consensus prompt pattern: 1) create `bootstrap/prompts/common/<name>.md`, 2) add variable + load in `Initializer.go` (follow `vulnConsensusPrompt` pattern), 3) add `{{<NAME>}}` replacement in `assemblePrompt()` in `members.go`, 4) add `{{<NAME>}}` placeholder to each agent prompt `.md` file
- Adding a new agent: 1) create `bootstrap/prompts/agents/<name>.md` (include `{{ENV}}`, `{{COMMAND_EXECUTION}}`, `{{VULN_CONSENSUS}}`, `{{OUTPUT_CONSENSUS}}` as needed), 2) add `init<Name>()` in `members.go` (follow existing agent pattern), 3) add skill folder path var + const in `Initializer.go`, 4) add folder to `checkSkillsFolder()` slice, 5) register agent in `initTeam()` team.New member list, 6) add agent definition + dispatch rules in Captain prompt (`captain.md`)

## Directory Map
- `bootstrap/` — Agent prompt embedding (`//go:embed`), Initializer, member assembly
- `session/` — Agent runtime: summarizer, LocalExec lifecycle, prompt embedding (`prompt/*`)
- `handler/` — HTTP/gRPC handlers or Captain orchestration entry points
- `config/` — Config struct and YAML loading (`HackerTeam.yaml`)
- `models/` — LLM provider constructors (OpenAI, Anthropic SDK wrappers)
- `tui/` — tview-based terminal UI, PTY management
- `toolsets/` — Agent toolset definitions (LocalExec skills, etc.)
- `functionTools/` — Custom Go function tools for agents
- `utils/pretty/` — Centralized TUI color constants (`TuiXxx`)

## Dependencies
- `trpc-agent-go` uses a **fork replacement** in `go.mod`: `replace trpc.group/trpc-go/trpc-agent-go => github.com/Rememorio/trpc-agent-go v0.0.0-...`
- Do not remove this replace directive — upstream lacks fixes needed for this project

## Skill System
- External security tools (nmap, nuclei, sqlmap, etc.) are integrated as knowledge-only skills via `trpc-agent-go`'s built-in skill system — NOT as function tools
- Skills use `llmagent.WithSkillToolProfile(llmagent.SkillToolProfileKnowledgeOnly)` — injected into system prompt, execution still via LocalExec
- Each agent gets its own skill subdirectory: `.HackerTeam/<Role>Skills/` (ReconSkills, ScannerSkills, ExploitSkills, PostExploitSkills, ReproducerSkills — Reproducer's folder is intentionally left empty, no pentest-tool skills)
- Embedded skill template: `bootstrap/skillsTemplates/pentest-tools/SKILL.md.template`
- `/flush` must re-create skill repos and re-attach to agents

## Agent Framework Gotchas
- Captain dispatches agents **serially** (Recon → Scanner → Exploit → PostExploit → Reproducer in two batches), not in parallel — `WithEnableParallelTools` is disabled; parallel dispatch causes framework-level issues when skill + localexec toolsets coexist
- `HistoryScope` is **NOT** set to Isolated — the framework default is `HistoryScopeParentBranch`, meaning sub-agents inherit Captain's conversation branch history. Code does not override this default.
- `LocalExec.submit_command` executes immediately (submit+start merged into one async call) — agents MUST poll `get_status` before `get_output`; `start_command` tool no longer exists
- `localexec.Manager` is per-agent, not a global singleton — `LocalExec()` creates a new Manager for each `LocalExecToolSet` instance; global `cache.go` removed
- `team.WithMemberToolStreamInner(true)` + `team.WithMemberToolInnerTextMode(team.InnerTextModeInclude)` — TUI shows sub-agent full transcript (text+tool calls+results); use `InnerTextModeExclude` to show only progress signals, hiding assistant text
