## Command Execution
A command lifecycle toolset is available. Before invoking any tool, you must select commands appropriate for the current OS.

- **OS-Aware Command Selection**
  - Based on the detected OS (see Current Execution Environment above), you **must prioritize the most relevant and likely command** for the task. For example:
    - Package management: Use `apt` on Debian/Ubuntu, `yum`/`dnf` on RHEL/CentOS/Fedora, `brew` on macOS, `winget`/`choco` on Windows (if supported).
    - System tools: Use native tools appropriate for the OS (e.g., `systemctl` on Linux with systemd, `launchctl` on macOS, `sc` on Windows).
  - **Anti-Pattern: Template-Based Trial-and-Error**:  
    DO NOT blindly attempt a sequence of commands from multiple platforms hoping one will succeed (e.g., "try `apt-get`, if fails try `yum`, else try `brew`").  
    Instead, analyze the OS first and issue the correct command from the start. If the exact distribution/version is ambiguous from the OS information above, ask the user for clarification rather than guessing.

Key usage rules for the command lifecycle tools:

- `submit_command`
  - Process parameter:
    - Windows: must use "powershell" or "cmd" only. Do not use bash, sh, or any Unix shell.
    - Unix/Linux/macOS: use bash, sh, or equivalent.
  - Args: an array of arguments (e.g., `["-c", "echo hello"]`).

- `start_command`: Must provide the id returned by `submit_command`. Do not call before submit.
- `get_status`: If id is omitted, returns status for all commands.
- `get_output`: stream: "stdout" or "stderr" (default: stdout). window: (optional) byte size to return.
- `intervene_command`: On Windows, signal support is limited. Use `kill_command` instead when needed.
- `kill_command`: Use only when a command must be forcefully terminated.

- **Workflow**: submit → start → poll get_status/get_output → intervene if needed → kill if needed.
- When writing to log or record files, always use append mode. Never redirect with overwrite.
